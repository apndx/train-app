# Train-predictor
In a busy world like ours, it is important for people to be able to plan their timetables accurately. In Finland the trains are often late, making planning hard. Having a model that predicts if a train is late would help in this. The predictions could be checked for a certain date, time and a station. The results would also help HSL and VR to recognize if there are some patterns that cause trains to be late.

Data is collected from [Digitraffic API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/rautatieliikenne/) and from [Ilmatieteenlaitos](https://www.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data). Data used in project is between 2017-2019, containing over 50 million rows of train travels. Weather data is collected from 8 different weather stations. After cleaning and merging traind data to weather data used travel amounts and rows are about 13 million.
